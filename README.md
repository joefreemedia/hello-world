# hello-world
My first repository

Hey Everyone,
I'm a developer who has lost touch with his craft and is doing everything he needs to in order to get that old thing back. A lack of purpose in my last position has left me unmotivated to grow technically and the current job market has exposed this. I'm back with the hunger, drive, and enthusiasim I had in college to learn and develop some cool things on today's web.

Thank You and check back soon to view all my progress.
Geoffrey Trenard
